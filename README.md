# EVI – A Mini‑Planetary Expedition

**EVI** is a hidden‑object space exploration game built with Unity (WebGL) and embedded in my portfolio contact page.  
It rewards curiosity with a short, self‑contained journey across five planets, a flag‑planting mission, and a collect‑the‑gems objective.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- **Goal**  
  Visit 5 planets, plant a flag on each, collect one unique gem per planet, and return all gems to Earth.

- **Core loop**  
  1. Choose a planet  
  2. Fly there using simple 2D physics (thrust, gravity, orbit)  
  3. Land (forgiving, satisfying landing)  
  4. Plant a flag & collect the gem  
  5. Return to Earth  
  6. Repeat for all 5 planets

- **Completion**  
  After all 5 gems are returned, Evi thanks the player and the contact form appears.

- **Persistence**  
  Progress is saved automatically (via PlayerPrefs + localStorage bridge).  
  Completed planets stay completed. Gems stay collected.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Reward curiosity** – hidden inside the contact page, no forced pop‑ups.
- **Simple but complete** – a small game with a clear win state.
- **Portfolio as playground** – demonstrates Unity WebGL integration, save states, and player‑centric design.
